### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, Part 3 was a favorite because creating images was something
    that was an interest of mine. When I found out how I creating an image
    works using RGB and all the different functions that go into creating
    an image, I was astounded. I thought it was very simple when you just
    had to create different values for the red, blue, and green, but it was
    much more than that.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, Part 1 was another favorite of mine because it was a combination
    of Lab 10, however it was also adding "animation" to the picture. This
    allowed to create a cool effect for the image when the program was being
    run. However, the coding was the challenging part because this was using
    a lot more functions.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, Part 2 was also one of my favorites because this lab was also a
    combination of the other labs. This program was creating an image that is
    also in part a gif animation. However, it is also using random variables
    and creating a message at the same time. This one was even more difficult
    because this had more even more functions and even more concepts that we
    just learned.
